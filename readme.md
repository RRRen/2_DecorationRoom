# My Second Starter VR Project

I spent 10 hours to accomplish my second VR app. It took me a while figuring out how to set a single animation but it was joy of accomplishment. I really enjoyed adjusting lights and material to make the apartment look great. Well, It would be better if the course can be more specific about the material part, like how to create different material.
